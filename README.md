# Fantastic coffee (decaffeinated)

This repository contains the basic structure for [Web and Software Architecture](http://gamificationlab.uniroma1.it/en/wasa/) homework project.
It has been described in class.

"Fantastic coffee (decaffeinated)" is a simplified version for the WASA course, not suitable for a production environment.
The full version can be found in the "Fantastic Coffee" repository.

## Project structure

* `cmd/` contains all executables; Go programs here should only do "executable-stuff", like reading options from the CLI/env, etc.
	* `cmd/healthcheck` is an example of a daemon for checking the health of servers daemons; useful when the hypervisor is not providing HTTP readiness/liveness probes (e.g., Docker engine)
	* `cmd/webapi` contains an example of a web API server daemon
* `demo/` contains a demo config file
* `doc/` contains the documentation (usually, for APIs, this means an OpenAPI file)
* `service/` has all packages for implementing project-specific functionalities
	* `service/api` contains an example of an API server
	* `service/globaltime` contains a wrapper package for `time.Time` (useful in unit testing)
* `vendor/` is managed by Go, and contains a copy of all dependencies
* `webui/` is an example of a web frontend in Vue.js; it includes:
	* Bootstrap JavaScript framework
	* a customized version of "Bootstrap dashboard" template
	* feather icons as SVG
	* Go code for release embedding

Other project files include:
* `open-npm.sh` starts a new (temporary) container using `node:lts` image for safe web frontend development (you don't want to use `npm` in your system, do you?)

## Go vendoring

This project uses [Go Vendoring](https://go.dev/ref/mod#vendoring). You must use `go mod vendor` after changing some dependency (`go get` or `go mod tidy`) and add all files under `vendor/` directory in your commit.

For more information about vendoring:

* https://go.dev/ref/mod#vendoring
* https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2020/04/modules-06-vendoring.html

## Node/NPM vendoring

This repository contains the `webui/node_modules` directory with all dependencies for Vue.JS. You should commit the content of that directory and both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

## How to set up a new project from this template

You need to:

* Change the Go module path to your module path in `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and in `*.go` files around the project
* Rewrite the API documentation `doc/api.yaml`
* If no web frontend is expected, remove `webui` and `cmd/webapi/register-webui.go`
* If no cronjobs or health checks are needed, remove them from `cmd/`
* Update top/package comment inside `cmd/webapi/main.go` to reflect the actual project usage, goal, and general info
* Update the code in `run()` function (`cmd/webapi/main.go`) to connect to databases or external resources
* Write API code inside `service/api`, and create any further package inside `service/` (or subdirectories)

## How to build

If you're not using the WebUI, or if you don't want to embed the WebUI into the final executable, then:

```shell
go build ./cmd/webapi/
```

If you're using the WebUI and you want to embed it into the final executable:

```shell
./open-npm.sh
# (here you're inside the NPM container)
npm run build-embed
exit
# (outside the NPM container)
go build -tags webui ./cmd/webapi/
```

## How to run (in development mode)

You can launch the backend only using:

```shell
go run ./cmd/webapi/
```

If you want to launch the WebUI, open a new tab and launch:

```shell
./open-npm.sh
# (here you're inside the NPM container)
npm run dev
```

## Known issues

### Apple M1 / ARM: `failed to load config from`...

If you use Apple M1/M2 hardware, or other ARM CPUs, you may encounter an error message saying that `esbuild` (or some other tool) has been built for another platform.

If so, you can fix issuing these commands **only the first time**:

```shell
./open-npm.sh
# (here you're inside the NPM container)
npm install
exit
# Now you can continue as indicated in "How to build/run"
```

**Use these instructions only if you get an error. Do not use it if your build is OK**.

### My build works when I use `npm run dev`, however there is a Javascript crash in production/grading

Some errors in the code are somehow not shown in `vite` development mode. To preview the code that will be used in production/grading settings, use the following commands:

```shell
./open-npm.sh
# (here you're inside the NPM container)
npm run build-prod
npm run preview
```
